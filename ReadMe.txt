F.Y.I.
===================================
This game requires a fairly robust machine to run properly.  I wrote it on a 3GHz P4 with a 128MB Video card which probably keeps me blissfully ignorant of frame speed issues.  I would recommend at least a 1.2GHz CPU with 32MB of video RAM.  It is unfortunately rather CPU intensive in places (bad programmer, bad!).  This game also needs at least DirectX7 installed.

Level data is stored in "levels.txt", which you can modify at your own risk of making things go horribly wrong with the game!  I have no plans to make a level editor because really, who wants to spend time making levels for a 2D shooter?  Just shoot stuff!!

I suppose I'm still not done with it yet, but the main body of work is complete now, so it seemed like a good time to upload it.

As you can see by the credits, I acquired a lot of knowledge and code from sites like PSC and others (to whom I am eternally grateful) and I hope people will see how you can build it all into something without having to start everything from scratch.  If you find any of MY code useful, so much the better!

I would like to also mention that all the 3D-looking sprite graphics were modeled using Anim8or by Steve Glanville. I've been using it for a few years and I think it has got to be the most incredible piece of freeware on the internet.  Get it at www.anim8or.com - you WILL be amazed!
